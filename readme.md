# **Lets recall python ðŸ”¥**

Here are some the beginner challenges in python. This helps me to refresh my python knowledge. I hope this challenges are help you to refresh your python skills too!

## 1. Count the vowels in a string

Create a function in Python that accepts a single word and returns the number of vowels in that word. In this function, only a, e, i, o, and u will be counted as vowels â€” not y.

## 2. Hide the credit card number

Write a function in Python that accepts a credit card number. It should return a string where all the characters are hidden with an asterisk except the last four. For example, if the function gets sent "4444444444444444", then it should return "4444".

## 3. Are the Xs equal to the Os?

Create a Python function that accepts a string. This function should count the number of Xs and the number of Os in the string. It should then return a boolean value of either True or False.

If the count of Xs and Os are equal, then the function should return True. If the count isn't the same, it should return False. If there are no Xs or Os in the string, it should also return True because 0 equals 0. The string can contain any type and number of characters.

## 4. Give me the discount

Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first should be the full price of an item as an integer. The second should be the discount percentage as an integer.

The function should return the price of the item after the discount has been applied. For example, if the price is 100 and the discount is 20, the function should return 80.
